```python
# Python code to calculate the first 10,000 terms of the series
# 1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...
terms = 10000

total_sum = 0

for n in range(terms):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        total_sum += 1 / (2 * n + 1)
    else:
        total_sum -= 1 / (2 * n + 1)

# Multiply by 4
final_result = total_sum * 4
print(final_result)
```

Output of the code:
```
3.1414926535900345
