# Detailed Design for `accounts.py`

## Classes and Methods

### Class: `Account`

The `Account` class will model the user's account in the trading simulation platform. This class will encapsulate all necessary attributes and methods to manage an account, handle transactions, and calculate portfolio value, holdings, and profit/loss.

#### Attributes:
- `self.user_id`: `str` - A unique identifier for the user account.
- `self.balance`: `float` - The current cash balance in the user's account.
- `self.holdings`: `dict` - A dictionary mapping stock symbols to the number of shares held.
- `self.transactions`: `list` - A list of transaction records.

#### Methods:

1. `__init__(self, user_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
   - Initializes the account with a user ID and an initial deposit amount. Sets initial holdings to an empty dictionary and transactions to an empty list.

2. `deposit(self, amount: float) -> None`
   - Increases the account balance by the specified amount.

3. `withdraw(self, amount: float) -> bool`
   - Decreases the account balance by the specified amount if funds are sufficient. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

4. `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
   - Records the purchase of shares if sufficient funds are available. Updates holdings and balance accordingly. Returns `True` if successful, `False` if funds are insufficient.

5. `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
   - Records the sale of shares if enough shares are available. Updates holdings and balance accordingly. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.

6. `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
   - Calculates and returns the total value of the current portfolio by summing the current value of all shares owned.

7. `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
   - Computes and returns the profit or loss as the difference between the current portfolio value plus account balance and the initial deposit.

8. `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
   - Returns a copy of the current holdings dictionary.

9. `get_transaction_history(self) -> list`
   - Returns a copy of the transaction history as a list.

10. `get_profit_loss_at_time(self, timestamp: float) -> float`
    - Returns the profit or loss at a specified timestamp. This requires historical price data for accurate calculation.

11. `get_share_price(self, symbol: str) -> float`
    - Retrieves the current price of a given stock symbol. Will use an external function or a mock function for testing.

### Additional Functions

#### `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
   - (Outside of the class; test implementation will provide fixed prices.)
   - Returns fixed prices: AAPL = 150.0, TSLA = 700.0, GOOGL = 2800.0.

## Implementation Example

An example implementation of the methods for testing purposes will create an `Account` object, run various transactions, and output the state of the account after these actions to test the validity of the design.

Note: Data persistence and concurrency control are not addressed in this design and should be considered in the next implementation phase.
