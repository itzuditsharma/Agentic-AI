# Detailed Design for the **accounts.py** Module

## Overview
The `accounts.py` module contains the implementation of the `Account` class, which represents a user's account on a trading simulation platform. The system allows for creating an account, managing funds, and handling transactions related to buying and selling shares. It includes functions for calculating portfolio value, profit/loss, and reporting transaction history and account holdings.

## System Components

### Class: Account

#### Attributes
- `account_id`: A unique identifier for the account.
- `balance`: A float representing the funds available in the account.
- `transactions`: A list to keep track of all transactions (buy/sell/deposit/withdraw).
- `holdings`: A dictionary to track the share symbol as keys and their respective quantities as values.
- `initial_deposit`: The amount of the initial deposit made into the account.

#### Methods

- `__init__(self, account_id: str, initial_deposit: float) -> None`
  - Initializes an account with a unique account id and an initial deposit.
  - Sets `balance` to `initial_deposit` and records the `initial_deposit`.

- `deposit_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Adds funds to the account balance.
  - Updates transactions to include the deposit action.
  - Returns `True` if the deposit is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `withdraw_funds(self, amount: float) -> bool`
  - Withdraws funds from the account balance.
  - Prevents overdrafts by ensuring the balance does not become negative.
  - Updates transactions to include the withdraw action.
  - Returns `True` if the withdrawal is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `buy_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Buys shares of a specified symbol using the current share price.
  - Prevents purchasing beyond available balance.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list and updates holdings.
  - Returns `True` if the purchase is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `sell_shares(self, symbol: str, quantity: int) -> bool`
  - Sells shares of a specified symbol at the current share price.
  - Prevents selling more shares than currently held.
  - Records the transaction in the transactions list and updates holdings.
  - Returns `True` if the sale is successful, otherwise `False`.

- `calculate_portfolio_value(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the total current value of all holdings based on current share prices.

- `calculate_profit_loss(self) -> float`
  - Calculates the difference between current total portfolio value plus balance and the initial deposit.

- `get_holdings(self) -> dict`
  - Returns current holdings in the form of a dictionary with share symbols as keys and quantities as values.

- `get_transactions(self) -> list`
  - Returns a list of all transactions that have occurred in the account.

#### Predefined Function

- `get_share_price(symbol: str) -> float`
  - Returns the current price of a given share symbol.
  - This function is provided externally with mock implementation returning fixed prices for AAPL, TSLA, GOOGL.

### Example Usage

```python
# Create a new account
account = Account(account_id='user123', initial_deposit=1000.0)

# Deposit funds into the account
account.deposit_funds(500.0)

# Withdraw funds from the account
account.withdraw_funds(200.0)

# Buy shares
account.buy_shares('AAPL', 5)

# Sell shares
account.sell_shares('AAPL', 2)

# Get the current portfolio value
portfolio_value = account.calculate_portfolio_value()

# Get the current profit or loss
profit_loss = account.calculate_profit_loss()

# Get the current holdings
holdings = account.get_holdings()

# Get the transaction history
transactions = account.get_transactions()
```

This design outlines the necessary classes and methods to implement a simple account management system for a trading simulation platform in a single Python module. It ensures all functionalities are self-contained, allowing for testing and simple user interface development.
